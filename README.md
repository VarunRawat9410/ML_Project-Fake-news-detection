fake news detection :NLP with disaster tweets
Social Media is the one of the most powerful tools available in this era of internet but as is the saying “with powers comes responsibilities” is indeed true here. Social media platforms can be used for spreading various types of fake news and it is a responsibility of platform as well as people to ensure that such news gets removed. In order to do that we must first classify which news is real or not.
In this project we are targeting a specific portion of these news that is news related to disasters and the social media platform that is used is twitter. We have to label tweets as fake or not based on whether   the tweet is actually about a disaster or is it some kind of propaganda for spreading fear or is simply used as a metaphor or expression in someone’s statement.
A suitable example will be: ‘On plus side look at the sky last night it was ablaze’. The author of the tweet explicitly uses the word “Ablaze” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially when there is visual aid but it’s less clear to a machine.
The project focuses on identifying a solution that could be used to detect and filter fake news related to Natural disasters for helping users on twitter.
